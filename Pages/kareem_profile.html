        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>I love, love, love cars. I don't even think that is enough loves to describe it either. I remember at at a young age I was always fascinated with cars and speed. One of my father's first cars when he came to this country was a 5-speed Dodge Dakota Turbo Coupe. I used to love sitting in the passengers seat and watching him run through the gears and listening to the the swish of turbo. I couldn't wait until I was 16 to drive it. Unfortunately, that day never came. My father received an offer he could not refuse and sold the car. I was heartbroken but I had a new goal to buy my own car and keep it forever. I read anything I could about cars (magazines, books from the library, newspaper articles). I worked and scraped and saved until I was able to purchase my first car at 17. A 1987 Honda Civic Sedan 5-speed. I wasn't doing well in school at the time, so I was unable to keep it. but it still brings a smile to my face.<br>
        <br>
        When I look back on my life, I don’t want
        to be more disappointed by the things
        I didn’t do than by the ones I did. It’s all
        about the relationships you have, great
        food, better drinks, and giving back. I
        joined Access Code because I want to
        learn skills to make my community better.
        I want to be a person that the younger
        generation can look up to for having a
        positive impact in the Bronx. I’m tired of
        the narrative that you need to leave your
        community for somewhere “better”. I want
        to become the change I want to see. I
        am also a beard aficionado, frugal wine
        taster, amateur bbq pit master &amp; part time
        outdoorsman. If you ever misplaced the
        remote and were too lazy to look for it, so
        you went to sleep with the tv on. I’m sure
        we will get along just fine.<br>
